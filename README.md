A few years ago a small molecule [SkQ1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkQ) was synthesized by the group of professor [Vladimir P. Skulachev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxfPTYRmYVM) in the [Moscow State University.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_State_University)

One part of SkQ1 functions as a molecular “tow truck” carrying the other part of the molecule – an extremely active antioxidant plastoquinone – into mitochondria.
